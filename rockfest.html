      <h4>Objective:</h4>
        <p>The objective was to promote my favorite festival of the summer in Montebello.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h4> Solution: </h4>
        <p> I came up with a quick stop-motion video with a typographic collage of all of the bands attending the festival. </p>

  <div class="processcontent">
    <p>I really wanted to approach the piece with everything I could! I started with conceptualizing what I wanted the piece to look like. I wanted to incorporate typography but also imagery so I grabbed every band and performers image from the official Rockfest site. I had to plan a lot of how it was going to work with plenty of sketches as well.</p>

    <p>Once the collage was completed, I printed them at a very large scale. I printed the letters and prepared for film day.

    <h4>Film prep: </h4>
      <p>I started this day bright and early- 6 am at the collage on a Sunday. I cut all of the letters out and every single image inside of the collage as well. </p>

  <div>
    <p>Once all of the words were together I needed to begin my final vision. I had to make different images move per photograph in reverse. </p>

  </div>

  <p>Once all of the footage was complete I brought it into after effects and since it took hundreds and hundreds of photos there wasnâ€™t much to do there. I added the music, adjusted some timing and removed my green screen effect. </p>
