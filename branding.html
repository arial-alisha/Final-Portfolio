<h1>Branding</h1>
  <p>When we think of fitness we think of the equipment in a gym and working out and feeling good. Most gym logos are directly represented by gym symbols but that has been overdone by many companies. I wanted to go outside of the normal gym style logo. With plenty of research I discovered that a triangle represents mind, body and spirit but it also represents the past, present and future. The logo is a bunch of different shaped triangles coming together. The triangles represent the positive effects of the gym on our minds, bodies and spirits. The logo is also symbolizing the different stages of improvement those who go to the gym are experiencing with the past, the present and the future being their goals. Finally people from all shapes and sizes do attend the gym and the more they go the better they feel and the greater impact they have. The position of the triangles represents the impact everyone coming together at the gym/community makes.</p>
