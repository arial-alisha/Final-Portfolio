    <div class="objective">
      <h4>Objective:</h4>
        <p>Create a new brand for Best Body Fitness so that the company is more approachable. The brand needed to show that it is a gym but also a place for the community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h4> Solution: </h4>
        <p>I created an approachable brand that is fun, energetic and incorporates the community. I applied the brand to stationary, web design mock-ups and brand guidelines.</p></div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4 class="aboutr">A bit about the project</h4>
      <p class="descrip">This was an exercise to go through all of the steps involved in branding a company. Starting with the initial research all the way to applying the new brand to everything. Going through a re-brand is a big process but will definitely earn the respect of the clients. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="processcontent">
    <p>When we think of fitness we think of the equipment in a gym and working out. Most existing gym logos are a direct representation of gym symbols but I wanted to steer away from the “norm.”  </p>

        <p>(image of sketching phase)</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>After much research, mood boards, and sketching I chose to move forward with triangles.

        <br>The triangle represents the mind, body and spirit but it also represents the past, present and the future. Much like we work on our minds, our bodies and spirits through fitness. We also use the gym and fitness as a way to see the improvements from the past, the present and the future.</p>

        <p>(image of triangle sketches)</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Once I solidified the theme of the brand, I went in and started matching all sorts of logo choices with word marks. Just because the concept is strong it is not enough to create the brand there is still much more to it then that. </p>

    <div>
      <p>I then applied the brand it to stationary, website mock-ups, and brand guidelines. </p>
